# Walmart Labs - Programming Challenge :zap:
This assignment was written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It is supposed to assign seats within a movie theater to fulfill reservation requests. 

I decided to use JavaScript and jQuery instead (even though Java would be easier) since:
- I wanted to practice coding in JavaScript and jQuery
- It's more representative of my abilities as a front-end web developer
- It's prettier (maybe not the code but the end result is)

### Instructions
1. Go to [tiffwong.github.io/walmart](https://tiffwong.github.io/walmart/)
