# Walmart Labs - Programming Challenge :zap:
This assignment was written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It is supposed to assign seats within a movie theater to fulfill reservation requests. 

I decided to use JavaScript and jQuery instead (even though Java would be easier) since:
- I wanted to practice coding in JavaScript and jQuery
- It's more representative of my abilities as a front-end web developer
- It's prettier (maybe not the code but the end result is)

## Instructions
1. Go to [tiffwong.github.io/walmart](https://tiffwong.github.io/walmart/) (you can also download the repository and run it locally)
2. Upload a file that matches the input description provided below

> **Input Description:**
>
> Each line represents a reservation request. A reservation request will contain a reservation identifier (R###) and the number of seats requested.
> ```
> R001 2
> R002 4
> R003 4
> R004 3
> ...
> ```

3. Optional: Download the output file

> **Output Description:**
> 
> Each line contains the reservation identifier and a comma-delimited list of the assigned seats.
> ```
> R001 A0,A1
> R002 A2,A3,A4,A5
> R003 A6,A7,A8,A9
> R004 A10,A11,A12
> ...
> ```
